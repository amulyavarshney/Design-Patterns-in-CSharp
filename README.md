# Design Patterns in CSharp

This repository contains the implementation of various design patterns in the CSharp programming language. The design patterns covered in this repository include Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns. The aim of this repository is to make it easier for developers to understand the concepts and patterns behind these design patterns.

## Creational Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite

## Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Each design pattern is accompanied by a brief description and example code to help you understand the pattern and how it can be implemented in your own projects. The code is also well-commented to help you understand what each line of code is doing.

## Usage
To use the code from this repository in your own projects, you can either download the repository as a zip file or clone it using Git. Once you have the code, you can run the code for each design pattern to see how it works and how you can implement it in your own projects.
